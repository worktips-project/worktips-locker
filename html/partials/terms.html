            <div class="section-head-terms">4. Description of Services</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms">As described in more detail below, our Service provides in browser software that (a) generates and stores a Worktips public address and the associated private view key, and (b) facilitates the submission of Worktips transaction requests to the Worktips network without requiring you to personally download and install the associated Worktips client software.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.1. Account Address and Private Key.</strong> When you create an Account, the Service (software in your browser), generates a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive Worktips via the Worktips network. The view key of the account is stored by the Service, which enables it to determine any transactions that are meant for your account. The private spend key is never stored or known by the Service, which means that it is cryptographically impossible for us to spend funds on your behalf. The combined public keys generated by the Service serve as your Worktips account address, and may be shared with the Worktips network and with others to complete Worktips transactions. The private key uniquely matches the account address and must be used in connection with the account address to create transactions to send Worktips from that account address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and your Private Login Key. You acknowledge and agree that anybody that has access to your Private Login Key and/or private key pair will be able to access, spend or transfer the Worktips associated with that account address.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.2. No Private Login Key Retrieval.</strong> Our Service do not receive or store your Account's Private Login Key nor the unencrypted private spend key. Therefore, we cannot assist you with Account Private Login Key retrieval. Our Service provides you with tools to help you reveal your Private Login Key when logged in, in order to facilitate backups by you, but the Service cannot generate a new Private Login Key for your Account. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account Private Login Key. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEPARATELY STORED A BACKUP OF ANY ACCOUNT ADDRESSES AND PRIVATE LOGIN KEY OR PRIVATE VIEW/SPEND KEY PAIRS MAINTAINED IN YOUR ACCOUNT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY WORKTIPS YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ACCOUNT ADDRESSES WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT PRIVATE LOGIN KEY.</strong></div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.3. Transaction Requests.</strong> All proposed Worktips transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Worktips public ledger via the Worktips distributed consensus network ("Verification Network"), which is not owned, controlled or operated by us. The Service help you submit your Worktips transaction request for confirmation to the Verification Network. However, the Worktips network, including the Verification Network, is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. We have no control over the Worktips network, including the Verification Network, and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction request you submit via the Service will be confirmed via the Verification Network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction requests you submit via the Service may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Verification Network. When you complete a transaction request via our Service, you authorize us to submit your transaction request to the Verification Network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Service.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.4. No Storage or Transmission of Worktips.</strong> No Storage or Transmission of Worktips. Worktips are an intangible asset, they exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the Worktips network. The Service does not store, send or receive Worktips. Any transfer of title in Worktips occurs within the decentralized Worktips network and not within the Service.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.5. Relationship.</strong> Company is an independent contractor for all purposes, and is not your agent or trustee.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.6. Accuracy of Information.</strong> Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Service is accurate and complete. You acknowledge and agree that the Company is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Worktips transaction initiated via the Service. For instance, if you mistype a account address or otherwise provide incorrect information in connection with any transaction request to send Worktips via the Service, the Worktips will be sent to whatever account address or information you provide. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction request details carefully before completing any transaction requests via the Service.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.7. No Cancellations or Modifications.</strong> Once a transaction request has been submitted to the Worktips Verification Network via the Service, the Verification Network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request. The Company has no control over the Worktips Verification Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. As a result, all transaction requests initiated via the Service are irreversible.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>4.8. Taxes.</strong> It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you complete via the Service, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that the Company is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Worktips transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Worktips transactions.</div>

            <div class="section-head-terms">5. Fees</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>5.1. Company Fees.</strong> Access to the account is free, but the Company may charge fees for additional Service. Specifically, the Company may charge a fee for every transaction that is sent. Should the Company choose to charge fees, they will be displayed separately in each Service.</div>
            <div class="section-body-terms"><strong>5.2. Miners Fees.</strong><br />
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><strong>Overview of Worktips Mining.</strong> The Worktips Verification Network (described above) is operated by a network of computers that have installed the Worktips network software. The individuals who operate those computers, called "miners," voluntarily participate in the Verification Network confirmation process. Worktips miners compile a list of pending Worktips transactions, called "blocks," verify that each transaction in the block is valid and does not involve an attempt to re-spend Worktips, and solve a mathematical algorithm to confirm that the block should be added to the public ledger of confirmed blocks, called the "blockchain." Worktips mining is a competitive process. The first miner to verify the transactions in a block and solve the associated algorithms receive (i) an amount of Worktips as a reward, which are generated automatically via the Worktips network, and (ii) any fees voluntarily included within the block by the individuals who initiated the proposed transactions ("Miners Fees"). Since miners verify Worktips transactions on a voluntary basis, it is necessary to include a Miners Fee in order to provide an incentive to the miners to add a proposed transaction to the next block for confirmation via the Verification Network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Miners Fees Options.</strong> At this stage, our Service allows you to modify the Miners Fee between four tiers of expected confirmation time. It is  calculated based on a per-kilobyte basis dependent on the physical data size of the transaction, which is not necessarily related to the amount of Worktips that is being transferred. Confirmation Times are only estimates and the Company cannot ensure any transaction is mined into a block within a specified time.</li>
                </ol>
                You acknowledge and agree that Company does not receive any Miners Fees in connection with providing the Service, and is not responsible for the speed at which your transactions may be verified by miners.
